# Application Workarounds

Custom fixes for application behavior.

Example:
eclipse-x11.desktop

Used when:
- Default behavior is broken
- Wayland/X11 mismatches occur
- System-specific overrides are needed
- Or just it's a fucking Hyprland that works the way it wants.

Keep workarounds isolated from core logic.
