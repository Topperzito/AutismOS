A small ecosystem of scripts, configs and deployment tools.

This is not production infrastructure.
This is not a general-purpose configuration manager.

It’s a playground that occasionally produces stable, reusable deployment artifacts.

- If it works, we keep it.
- If it breaks, we fix it or delete it... Or keep it. I have no fucking clue what really is happening here.
- If it’s ugly but useful, it stays.

Some parts are reusable.
Some are experiments.
Some are both.
