# AutismOS

A small ecosystem of scripts, configs and deployment tools.

This is not production infrastructure.
This is not a general-purpose configuration manager.

It’s a playground that occasionally produces stable, reusable deployment artifacts.

If it works, we keep it.
If it breaks, we fix it or delete it.
If it’s ugly but useful, it stays.
