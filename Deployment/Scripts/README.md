# Deployment Helper Scripts

Utility scripts supporting the deployment engine.

---

## check-deps.sh

Ensures required binaries exist before deployment begins.

Prevents partial execution failures.

---

## pack-deployable.sh

Packages resources into a deployable archive format.

Used to create self-contained deployment bundles that can be recursively processed.

---

Keep helpers separate from engine logic.
