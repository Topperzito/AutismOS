Each plugin defines how a resource should be processed:
- archive extraction
- recursive archive deployment
- file installation
- symlink creation

This is not declarative.
Execution order matters.

---

## Intended Use

- Rebuilding dev machines
- Packaging system fragments
- Testing reproducible setups
- Experimenting with deployment logic

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a replacement for Nix
- Not Ansible
- Not Kubernetes
- Not secure by default

It’s controlled chaos with version control.

---

## Warning

Some scripts use plaintext credentials.
Do not deploy blindly on production systems.

---

Use at your own risk.
Refactor when needed.
Delete what you don't use.
