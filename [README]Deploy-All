# Deploy-All.sh

Main orchestration script for the deployment engine.

It:

1. Validates required dependencies
2. Loads plugin definitions
3. Executes deployment operations
4. Handles archives, files and symlinks

---

## How It Works

Deployment behavior is defined via JSON plugins in:

Deployment/Plugins/

The script delegates execution based on plugin `name`.

No magic.
No dependency resolution.
No rollback.

Just execution.

---

## Requirements

- bash
- tar
- realpath
- install (coreutils)

---

## Limitations

- No dry run mode
- No transactional rollback
- Minimal validation
- Trusts JSON definitions

---

## Design Goal

Simple and hackable over abstract and generic.

If it becomes complicated, rewrite it.
