# Standalone Scripts

These scripts are independent from the plugin engine.

Some are experiments.
Some are reusable.

---

## mariadb-clean-install.sh

Performs a clean MariaDB installation and setup.

Likely destructive if existing DB data is present.

Use only on fresh systems or controlled environments.

---

## a.sh

Utility script.
(Document its real purpose here.)

---

## passwords.json

Contains plaintext credentials.

Example:
:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

This is not secure.
Replace with environment variables or secret management if needed.
